# Wireframe to Website Generator

## Introduction

In the world of web development, the process of transforming a design concept into a functional website can be both time-consuming and complex. However, with the advent of generative AI models like **Gemini**, this process is becoming increasingly streamlined and accessible. This application specializes in converting hand-drawn wireframes into website code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). It empowers designers and developers alike to bring their website visions to life with unprecedented ease and efficiency.

In this lab, we will build a web application that allows users to generate website code from wireframes and user-defined prompts using **Vertex AI's Generative AI Models** (such as **Gemini 1.5 Flash** and **Gemini 1.5 Pro**). The application is built using **Flask**, a popular Python web framework, and leverages the **Vertex AI client library** to interact with the Generative Models service.

## Features

- **Upload Hand-Drawn Wireframes**: Users can upload an image of their hand-drawn wireframe.
- **Select a Model**: The app provides a selection of pre-trained Gemini models, optimized for different design styles.
- **Provide a Prompt**: Users can optionally provide a text prompt to guide the model's generation process.
- **Generate Website Code**: The app sends the wireframe and prompt to Gemini, which generates the corresponding website code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Display the Result**: The generated code is displayed on the app's response page, allowing users to easily copy or download the code.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Google Cloud Account** with access to Vertex AI
- **Flask** and necessary libraries

### Steps to Install and Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wireframe-to-website-generator.git
    cd wireframe-to-website-generator
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up Google Cloud Credentials**:
    - Ensure that you have your Google Cloud credentials set up. Follow [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) to authenticate the app for Vertex AI usage.

5. **Set Environment Variables**:
    Add your Google Cloud Project ID and other required configurations in a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your-project-id>
    ```

6. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

7. **Access the App**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## How the App Works

1. **Upload a Hand-Drawn Wireframe**: Users upload an image of their hand-drawn wireframe.
2. **Select a Model**: The app provides a selection of Gemini models optimized for different design styles.
3. **Provide a Prompt**: Users can optionally enter a text prompt to refine the website code generation.
4. **Generate Website Code**: The app sends the wireframe and prompt to Gemini, which generates the website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. **Display the Result**: The generated code is displayed on the app's response page, and users can copy or download the code.
